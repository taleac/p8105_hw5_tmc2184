> You can read their accompanying article here.

    ##  [9] "state"         "lat"           "lon"           "disposition"

> Describe the raw data. Create a city\_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore,

**This dataset comprises details of 52179 unsolved homicides from 50
major US cities in 50 states. There are a total of 14 variables in the
original dataset: city\_state, uid, reported\_date, victim\_last,
victim\_first, victim\_race, victim\_age, victim\_sex, city, state, lat,
and lon. The maximum number of homicides in a city was 5535, the minimum
was 208. The maximum number of unsolved homicides in a city was 4073,
the minimum was 95**

**The plot shows that subjects in the control (con) and experimental
(exp) condition start at around the same level for the outcome at week
0. However, whereas the control condition stays relatively stable, each
subject in the experimental condition shows a steady increase in the
outcome over time between weeks 0 and 8.**

**The sample average mu across tests is extremely close to the
population mu (e.g., across 5,000 repetitions of a random sample where
true population mu was equal to 1, the mean estimated sample mu was
essentially 1). However, when the null hypothesis was incorrectly
rejected, the sample estimate of mu was noticeably different than the
true population value (e.g., foa population mu of 1, if the null was
rejected, sample mu was estimated to be closer to 2). This makes sense,
because random sampling error will sometimes generate mean values that
are different from the population mean, and it is more likely that the
null hypothesis will be incorrectly rejected when this happens.**
